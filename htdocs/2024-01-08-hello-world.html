<h1 class="article-title">Hello World!</h1>
<small>on <a href="/blog">Béla's blog</a></small>
<p>After several attempts at starting a blog, this is it! Welcome to my
blog and my first blog post!</p>

<p>There are so many interesting blogs on the web. I love small self-made
personal websites. I&rsquo;m always happy when I stumble upon a new one. So I
have wanted to create my own self-made website for other people to
stumble upon for some time now.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really know what I will write about yet. I like writing about
things that I&rsquo;m currently interested in. Writing about something helps
me to understand it better. So I&rsquo;ll probably write about a lot of
technical computer science related stuff. Stuff I am working on or my
new favorite free and open source software. But maybe I&rsquo;ll also write
about art or politics. I really don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>

<p>But I do know that I will always try to link to interesting little
websites for further reading. Like this one:
<a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/19-website-discoverability-crisis/">The Small Website Discoverability Crisis</a>.
I like the Idea of publishing your favorite bookmarks. Here is my list
of favorite bookmarks:
<a href="/bookmarks.html">Béla&rsquo;s Bookmarks</a>.
I&rsquo;ll add to it in the future.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is it for today. I hope to see you again here on my little
blog. Enjoy your day :O).</p>
