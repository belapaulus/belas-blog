	Hi, I'm Béla and this is my blog. I think I'll mostly write about
	computer sience related topics, about things that I'm interested
	in or things that I'm currently learning about. Maybe there will be 
	some articles about music or politics or something completely
	different. We'll see. I hope you have a lot of fun reading. Here
	is a list of my articles:
