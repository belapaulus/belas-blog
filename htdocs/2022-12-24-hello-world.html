<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p>After several attempts at starting a blog, this is it, my own blog and
my first blog post :O). I enjoy reading blogs, DIY websites have a
special place in my heart and I have learned a lot from my favorite
blogs on the web and since I also enjoy writing I have wanted to start
a blog for some time now.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really know yet what I will write about. Probably a lot of
technical stuff. Writing about topics that interest me makes me learn
a lot. But maybe I will also write about music or art or politics. I
really don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>

<p>But I do know that I will always try to link to a lot of interesting,
self made websites. Here is the first one:
<a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/19-website-discoverability-crisis/">The Small Website Discoverability Crisis</a>.
You should go ahead and read it. It&rsquo;s the reason why I will always try
to link to a lot of interesting little websites. You can also find a
list of my favorite pages here: <a href="/bookmarks.html">Béla&rsquo;s Bookmarks</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is it for today. I hope to see you again here on my little
blog. Enjoy your day :O).</p>
