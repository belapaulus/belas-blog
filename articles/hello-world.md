After several attempts at starting a blog, this is it! Welcome to my
blog and my very first blog post!

There are so many interesting blogs on the web. I love small self-made
personal websites. I'm always happy when I stumble upon a new one. So I
have wanted to create my own self-made website for other people to
stumble upon for some time now. 

I don't really know what I will write about yet. I like writing about
the things that I'm currently interested in. Writing always improves
my understanding of a topic. So I'll probably write about a lot of
technical computer science related stuff. Stuff I am working on or my 
new favorite free and open source software. But maybe I'll also write
about art or politics. I really don't know yet.

But I do know that I will always try to link to interesting little
websites for further reading. Like this one: 
[The Small Website Discoverability Crisis](https://www.marginalia.nu/log/19-website-discoverability-crisis/).
I like the Idea of publishing your favorite bookmarks. Here is my list
of favorite bookmarks:
[BÃ©la's Bookmarks](/bookmarks.html).
I'll add to it in the future.

Anyway, this is it for today. I hope to see you again here on my little
blog. Enjoy your day :O).
