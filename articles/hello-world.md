After several attempts at starting a blog, this is it, my own blog and
my first blog post :O). I enjoy reading, DIY websites have a
special place in my heart and I have learned a lot from my favorite
blogs on the web and since I also enjoy writing I have wanted to start
a blog for some time now.

I don't really know yet what I will write about. I always learn a lot
from writing about topics that interest me. Probably a lot of technical
stuff. But maybe I will also write about music or art or politics. I
really don't know yet.

But I do know that I will always try to link to a lot of interesting,
self made websites. Here is the first one:
[The Small Website Discoverability Crisis](https://www.marginalia.nu/log/19-website-discoverability-crisis/).
You should go ahead and read it. It's the reason why I will always try
to link to a lot of interesting little websites. You can also find a
list of my favorite pages here: [BÃ©la's Bookmarks](/bookmarks.html).

Anyway, this is it for today. I hope to see you again here on my little
blog. Enjoy your day :O).
